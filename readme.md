#HTML & CSS Lab (complete)

Great work on the lab today! Here's a possible solution; feel free to take a peek at the code. 

Don't stress if your solution looks different -- there are many ways to implement certain things (for example, this solution uses sprites for the social media images -- we're introducing those next week, so it's cool if you used single images for those icons!).
